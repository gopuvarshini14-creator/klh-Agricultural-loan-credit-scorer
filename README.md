# 🌾 AI-Based Agricultural Loan Credit Scorer

## 📌 Overview
The AI-Based Agricultural Loan Credit Scorer predicts farmers’ creditworthiness using non-traditional agricultural data such as crop history, soil health, and weather patterns. It generates a Trust Score to help lenders make fair, data-driven loan decisions.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Over 70% of smallholder farmers lack formal credit history, making them invisible to banks. Traditional credit scoring systems fail to evaluate their real repayment capacity.

## 💡 Solution
Our system uses Machine Learning (XGBoost) to analyze alternative agricultural data and predict default risk. The model converts risk probability into a simplified Trust Score (0–100) for lenders.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- XGBoost
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- SQLite (for data storage)
- SHAP (for explainability)

## 🔍 Features
- Alternative data ingestion (crop, soil, weather)
- Feature engineering & preprocessing
- Credit risk prediction model
- Trust Score generation
- Explainable AI reports
- Model performance evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC)

## 📊 How It Works
1. Collect agricultural & environmental data  
2. Preprocess and engineer meaningful features  
3. Train XGBoost model  
4. Predict default probability  
5. Convert to Trust Score  
6. Generate lender-friendly report  

## 🎯 Impact
- Improves credit access for farmers  
- Reduces loan defaults  
- Enables inclusive and fair lending  

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Real-time satellite data integration  
- Mobile app for farmers  
- API integration with banking systems  
- Multilingual support
